### Anatomy of Skeletal Muscle
- Origin: most proximal attachment
- Insertion: more distal attachment
- **Muscle cells** AKA **muscle fibers**
	- **Satellite cells** differentiate into muscle when needed for growth & repair (allow you to rebuild muscle after injury)
	- cells bundles into **fascicles** surrounded by CT
- Fiber internal structures
	- **Sarcolemma**: cell membrane
	- **Sarcoplasm**: cytoplasm
	- **Sarcoplasmic reticulum:** ER that wraps around each myofibril like a piece of lace
	- **Network of transverse tubules:** T-tubules connected with the sarcolemma
	- **Triad** - T-tubule flanked by SR
	- **Terminal cisterna** - enlarged area that flanks the T-tubules
- T-tubules allow the sarcolemma to propagate AP towards inside of the cell
- Order of structures: skeletal muscle -> muscle fascicles -> muscle fiber

- **Myofibril** - contractile unit of skeletal muscle w/ thick & thin filaments
	- **Myosin (thick filaments)**
		- ![Pasted image 20240130112249.png|200](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240130112249.png)
	- **Actin (thin filaments)**
		- ![Pasted image 20240130112343.png|200](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240130112343.png)
		- **Troponin** - has 3 units including troponin T & C where Ca2+ attaches
		- **Tropomyosin** - attached to troponin; when signal comes in, troponin moves & pulls tropomyosin w/ it so myosin can attach to actin
	- **Titin** - HUGE elastic protein extending from Z-disk to M-line
		- stabilizes position of contractile filaments
		- it's elasticity returns the stretched muscle to resting length
	- **Nebulin** - inelastic protein that aligns actin

### Sarcomere: The Contractile Unit
#### ・❥・The Sarcomere During Contraction
- During contraction: sarcomere (space between Z-bands) shorten, I-band shortens, & H-band shortens
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Only the A band doesn't change length</mark>
### Excitation-Contraction Coupling
- Definition: refers to a combination of electrical and mechanical events in skeletal muscle and is comprised of 4 major events:
- **A. INITIATION OF MUSCLE ACTION POTENTIAL**
	1. ACh released from somatic motor neuron at NMJ
		- *1.5)* ACh binds Nictonic receptor on sarcolemma
	2. Na+ ions flow in -> depolarization of [[STUDY/UNTHSC '24/SPRING '23/Physiology/Exam 2/backlinks/end-plate potential (EPP)\|end-plate potential (EPP)]] -> muscle AP initiation
		- *2.5)* AP goes through sarcolemma & down T-tubule
- **B. EXCITATION CONTRACTION COUPLING**
	3. AP in T-tubule alters conformation of DHP receptor
	4. DHP receptor opens RyR Ca2+ release channels in SR -> Ca2+ enters cutoplasm
		- think of DHP & RyR as string attached to door
			- voltage hits DHP receptor gate channel -> pull sring & open door (RyR) on SR -> Ca2+ flows down concentration gradient
	5. Ca2+ binds troponin -> allows actin-myosin binding


	6. <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">ACh released from somatic motor neuron</mark>
	7. <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">ACh binds to Nicotinic receptor on sarcolemma</mark>
		- Na+ ions flow in, K+ ions flow out
		- Depolarization of end-plate potential (EPP)
	8. <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">AP triggers Ca2+ release from sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR)</mark>
		- Mediated by 2 membrane proteins: Voltage sensing L-type calcium channel dihydropyridine (DHP) receptor & ryanodine receptors (RyR)
			- think of DHP & RyR as string attached to door
			- voltage hits DHP receptor gate channel -> pull sring & open door (RyR) on SR -> Ca2+ flows down concentration gradient
	9. <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Calcium combines w/ troponin -> initiates contraction</mark>
### Events of Skeletal Muscle Contraction
- **[[STUDY/UNTHSC '24/SPRING '23/Physiology/Exam 2/backlinks/Sliding Filament Theory\|Sliding Filament Theory]]**
	1. ATP binds to myosin -> myosin releases actin
	2. ATP hydrolysis by myosin ATPase -> this cocks the myosin head
	3. Calcium binding to troponin T & C -> Troponin pulls tropomyosin away from actin's binding site 
	4. Myosin binds to actin -> power stroke
	5. Myosin releases ADP

## ୨⎯ part 2 ⎯୧
- <span style="color:#ffa3d9">Now we will discuss skeletal muscle contraction within a muscle fiber</span> (we call that a **muscle twitch**)
- single AP evokes a single muscle twitch
- twitch parameters: tension speed, maximum tension, & tension duration (tension = force created by contraction)

### Single Fiber Contraction Force
- force/tension developed during a single twitch is a direct reflection of the length of individual sarcomeres before contraction begins
	- resting sarcomere length -> determines # of crossbridges formed between the thick & thin filaments
	- the **[[STUDY/UNTHSC '24/SPRING '23/Physiology/Exam 2/backlinks/length-tension relationship\|length-tension relationship]]**: says <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">too much or too little overlap of thick & thin filaments in resting muscle (resting length) = results in decreased tension</mark>
		- its the amount of myosin & actin overlapped BEFORE the contraction
		- <mark style='background:#eb3b5a'>ON EXAM: ex q "potential development going from C to D on length-tension relationship graph"</mark>
#### ・❥・Factors Influencing Single Fiber Contraction Force
- single twitch tension does not represent maximal force production of a muscle fiber
- single fiber force production is largely dependent on the frequency at which APs stimulate the muscle fibers
	- summation: stronger contraction achieved when muscle fiber does not relax completely between APs
1. **Single Twitches:** muscle relaxes completely between stimuli
2. **Summation:** stimuli closer together do not allow muscle to relax fully -> we add the tension from both APs and summate them
3. **Summation Leading to Unfused Tetanus:** stimuli are far enough apart to allow muscle to relax slightly between stimuli
	- even though we have many APs arriving and you are hitting that peak, there's still some period of relaxation before the next AP arrives
	- *the period of relaxation is occurring just b/c it's not being stimulated fast enough* 
	- <mark style='background:#f7b731'>??we will still summate up to maximum tension point, until the period of relaxation which is when we get unfused tetanus</mark>
4. **Summation Leading to Complete Tetanus:** muscle reaches steady tension. if muscle fatigues -> tension decreases rapidly
	- unlike the unfused tetanus scenario, here there is no relaxation between successive APs so you get complete tetanus

### Whole Muscle Contraction Force
- <span style="color:#ffa3d9">Now we're back out to the whole muscle view and talk about the whole muscle itself</span>
- **Motor unit:** group of muscle fibers that function together & the somatic motor neuron that controls them
- Motor units can innervate variable numbers of muscle fibers 
	- ex: extraocular MUs -3-5 fibers (small/fine responses); gastrocnemius (calf) MU - ~2000 fibers (generates a lot of force w/o precision)
- Recruitment of additional motor units by the NS increases contraction force, but the # of innervated fibers determine the size of force gradation
	- Basically <span style='color:#20bf6b'>↑</span> <span style='color:#20bf6b'># of innervating fibers</span> = <span style='color:#20bf6b'>↑</span> <span style='color:#20bf6b'>ability to jump in contraction force</span>
- Asynchronous recruitment of MUs helps avoid fatigue
	- Basically... different motor units take turns maintaining tension
- A given MU innervates only ONE TYPE of muscle fiber (by muscle type we mean Type I & Type II)
- **[[STUDY/UNTHSC '24/SPRING '23/Physiology/Exam 2/backlinks/Henneman's Size Principle\|Henneman's Size Principle]]**: when moving a load, motor units are recruited from smallest (Type 1) to largest (Type 2)
	- Basically... you have small fibers w/ small MUs that generate small force w/ high precision
	- As you increase need to generate force b/c you are lifting a heavier thing, the threshold for recruitment goes up to allow you to do that

### Mechanics of Body Movement
- **[[STUDY/UNTHSC '24/SPRING '23/Physiology/Exam 2/backlinks/Isotonic & Isometric Contractions\|Isotonic contractions]]** create force & move a load
	- ***Concentric contraction*** is a shortening action (ex: bicep curl/flexion)
	- ***Eccentric contraction*** is a lengthening action (ex: tricep extension)
- **[[STUDY/UNTHSC '24/SPRING '23/Physiology/Exam 2/backlinks/Isotonic & Isometric Contractions\|Isometric contractions]]** create force without moving a load (ex: pushing ur house; making a fist)
	- We can generate these type of contractions b/c... series elastic elements allow sarcomeres to shorten while elastic elements stretch -> results in little change in overall length
#### ・❥・Levers & Fulcrums
- bones & muscles around joints form levers & fulcrums
- **lever** (formed by bone) - rigid bar that pivots around a point called a **fulcrum** (formed by flexible joints)
#### ・❥・Load-Velocity Relationship
- <mark style='background:#eb3b5a'>ON EXAM</mark>
- ![Pasted image 20240131080725.png|300](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240131080725.png)
- Contraction is fastest when the load is zero 
- When load = muscle maximal load capacity -> no movement occurs *(isometric contraction; point E)*

### 3 Metabolic Pathways to Obtain Energy (ATP) for Skeletal Muscle Contraction
- **Phosphocreatine breakdown:** short burst of energy (10s worth of ATP or less)
- **Anaerobic glycolysis:** <span style='color:#20bf6b'>quick energy production, no oxygen required,</span> <span style='color:#eb3b5a'>small amount of energy released</span>
- **Aerobic respiration (citric acid cycle and electron transport chain):** <span style='color:#eb3b5a'>slow, requires oxygen,</span> <span style='color:#20bf6b'>large amount of energy released</span>
- these 3 are always working at the same time but the activity of each depends on how much energy that activity needs

### Causes of Muscle Fatigue During Exercise
- Fatigue: reversible condition in which skeletal muscle is unable to maintain expected power output
- NOT due to critical reduction of ATP
1. [[STUDY/UNTHSC '24/SPRING '23/Physiology/Exam 2/Fatigue Mechanisms\|Central fatigue mechanisms]] - due to CNS changes
2. [[STUDY/UNTHSC '24/SPRING '23/Physiology/Exam 2/Fatigue Mechanisms\|Peripheral fatigue mechanisms]] - due to neuron or muscle changes

### Muscle Fiber Types
- **Slow-twitch fibers (type 1)**
	- Rely primarily on aerobic respiration 
	- More *“fatigue resistant”*
	- Smaller diameter, darker color due to myoglobin.
- **Fast-twitch fibers (type 2)**
	- Split ATP more rapidly
	- Develop tension faster
	- Pump Ca2+ into sarcoplasmic reticulum more rapidly 
	- More *“fatigueable”*
	- Larger diameter, pale color. 
	- 2 sub-classifications of fast-twitch fibers:
		1. **Fast-twitch oxidative-glycolytic fiber (type 2A)**
			- Use *aerobic and anaerobic* metabolism 
		2. **Fast-twitch glycolytic fibers (type 2X)**
			- Rely primarily on *anaerobic* glycolysis
			- *<span style="font-style:italic; color:#ffa3d9">Note: we use type 2X instead of 2B b/c 2B is for anything BUT humans</span>*
- Note: Fibers can switch type depending on activity and training
